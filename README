# normal-estimator

Uses [Jens Behley's C++ Octree](https://github.com/jbehley/octree) to estimate normals for a set of 3D pointcloud vertices and consistently signs them using an implementation of the algorithm described in [Surface Reconstruction from Unorganized Points](http://hhoppe.com/recon.pdf).
